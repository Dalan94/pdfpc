<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>pdfpc</B> [options] PDF-file



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote
       like multi-monitor output to provide meta information  to  the  speaker
       during the presentation.  It is able to show a normal presentation win‚Äê
       dow on one screen, while showing a more sophisticated overview  on  the
       other  one  providing  information like a picture of the next slide, as
       well as the left over time till the end of the presentation.  The input
       files  processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be created using
       nearly any of today's presentation software.

       To run pdfppc, simply type

              pdfpc file.pdf

       By default the presenter view appears in the primary  monitor  and  the
       presentation  view  in  the second monitor (provided you have two moni‚Äê
       tors).  If you want to swith displays, start with the  -s  option  (see
       below).

              Duration  in minutes of the presentation used for timer display.
              If not given or if a value of 0 is  specified,  the  clock  just
              measures the time in the presentation.

       <B>-l,</B> <B>--last-minutes</B><I>=N</I>
              Time  in  minutes,  from  which  on the timer changes its color.

       <B>-u,</B> <B>--current-size</B><I>=N</I>
              Percentage of the presenter screen to be used  for  the  current

<H2>FEATURES</H2><PRE>
   <B>Caching</B> <B>/</B> <B>Prerendering</B>
       To allow fast changes between the different slides of the  presentation
       the  pdf pages are prerendered to memory.  The progress bar on the bot‚Äê
       tom of the presenter screen indicates how many percent  of  the  slides
       situation.  The compression is enabled by default as it does  not  harm
       rendering  speed  in a noticeable way on most systems.  It does however
       slows down prerendering by about a factor of 2.  If you have got enough
       memory  and  want  to  ensure the fastest possible prerendering you can
       disable slide compression by using the -z switch. But be  warned  using
       the  uncompressed prerendering storage will use about 30 times the mem‚Äê
       ory the new compressed storage utilizes (aka  the  1.5gb  become  about
       50mb)



   <B>Timer</B>
       If  a  duration  is  given (-d option), the timer will show a countdown
       with the given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a  value
       of  0 is given to the -d option), the timer will show how much time has
       been spent.  The duration is stored automatically, so you do  not  need
       to repeat it for every invocation.

       The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for
       the first time.  This feature is quite useful as you may want  to  show
       the  titlepage of your presentation while people are still entering the
       room and the presentation hasn't really begun  yet.   If  you  want  to
       start  over  you  can use the r key which will make the presenter reset
       the timer.

       If a duration is given, at the moment the  timer  reaches  the  defined
       last-minutes  value it will change color to indicate your talk is near‚Äê
       ing its end.  As soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00)  it
       will  turn  red and count further down showing a negative time, to pro‚Äê
       vide information on how many minutes you are overtime.


   <B>Notes</B>
       Textual notes can be displayed for each slide.  While in the  presenta‚Äê
       tion,  pressing  n  will allow you to take notes for the screen.  To go
       out of editing mode, press the Escape key.  Note that while  editing  a
       note  the  keybindings  stop  working, i.e.  you are not able to change
       slides.

       The notes are stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy  to
       edit  also  from  outside the program.  See the section about the pdfpc
       format below.


   <B>Overview</B> <B>mode</B>
       Pressing tab you can enter the overview mode, where miniatures for  the
       slides  are  shown.  You can select one slide to jump to with the mouse
       or with the arrow keys.  You can also define overlays and the end slide
       (see next sections) in this mode.


   <B>Overlays</B>


       ¬∑ If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previ‚Äê
         ous slide.  That means that we are in the middle of an overlay we can
         jump forward and backward through the single steps of it

       ¬∑ If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first
         one),  but  the  previous  slides  are,  we jump to the previous user
         slide.  This means that when going back in the  presentation  you  do
         not  have to go through every step of the overlay, Pdf Presenter Con‚Äê
         sole just shows the first slide of the each overlay.  As you normally
         only  go  back  in  a presentation when looking for a concrete slide,
         this is more convenient.

       The up and down cursor keys work on a user slide basis.   You  can  use
       them  to  skip  the  rest of an overlay or to jump to the previous user
       slide, ignoring the state of the current slide.

       When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated
       in  the  presenter view, just below the main view, showing the next and
       the previous slide in an overlay.

       Pdf Presenter Console tries to find  these  overlays  automatically  by
       looking  into  the  page  labels in the pdf file.  For LaTeX this works
       correctly at least with the beamer class and also  modifying  the  page
       numbers  manually  (compiling with pdflatex).  If your preferred slide-
       producing method does not work correctly with this detection,  you  can
       supply  this information using the o key for each slide that is part of
       an overlay (except  the  first  one!).   The  page  numbering  is  also
       adapted.  This information is automatically stored.


   <B>End</B> <B>slide</B>
       Some  people like to have some additional, backup slides after the last
       slide in the actual presentation.  Things like bibliographic references
       or slides referring to specialized questions are typical examples.  Pdf
       Presenter Console lets you define which is the last slide in the actual
       presentation  vie  the 'e' key.  This just changes the progress display
       in the presenter screen, as to have  a  better  overview  of  how  many
       slides are left.

   <B>pdfpc</B> <B>Files</B>
       The  notes  and  other additional information are stored in a file with
       the extension "pdfpc".  When invoking Pdf Presenter Console with a  non
       pdfpc  file, it automatically checks if there exists such a file and in
       this case loads the additional information.  This means that  you  nor‚Äê
       mally do not have to deal with this kind of files explicitly.

       There  are however cases where you may want to edit the files manually.
       The most typical case is if you add or remove  some  slides  after  you
       have  edited  notes or defined overlays.  It may be quicker to edit the
       pdfpc file than to re-enter the whole information.  Future versions may
