SYNOPSIS
       pdfpc [options] PDF-file


DESCRIPTION
       pdfpc  is  a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote like
       multi-monitor output to provide meta information to  the  speaker  during  the
       presentation.   It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen,
       while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other one providing  infor‐
       mation  like  a  picture of the next slide, as well as the left over time till
       the end of the presentation.  The input files processed by pdfpc are PDF docu‐
       ments, which can be created using nearly any of today's presentation software.

       To run pdfppc, simply type

              pdfpc file.pdf

       By default the presenter view appears in the primary monitor and the presenta‐
       tion view in the second monitor (provided you have two monitors).  If you want
       to swith displays, start with the -s option (see below).


OPTIONS
       -d, --duration
              Duration  in minutes of the presentation used for timer display. If not
              given or if a value of 0 is specified, the clock just measures the time
              in the presentation.

       -l, --last-minutes=N
              Time  in minutes, from which on the timer changes its color. (Default 5
              minutes)

       -u, --current-size=N
              Percentage of the presenter screen to be used for  the  current  slide.
              (Default 60)

       -s, --switch-screens
              Switch the presentation and the presenter screen.

       -c, --disable-cache
              Disable  caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost
              of speed.

       -z, --disable-compression
              Disable the compression of slide images to trade memory consumption for
              speed.  (Avg.  factor 30)

       -b, --black-on-end
              Add an additional black slide at the end of the presentation

       -S, --single-screen

       Down cursor key
              Go forward one user slide (see section about overlays below)

       Left cursor key / Page up / Right mouse button
              Go back one slide

       Shift + Left cursor key / Page up / Right mouse button
              Go back 10 slides

       Up cursor key
              Go back one "user slide" (see section about overlays below)

       Home   Go to the first slide

       End    Go to the last slide

       Tab    Toggle overview mode

       g      Input a slide number to jump to

       Escape / q
              Exit pdfpc

       b      Turn off the presentation view (i.e.  fill it with a black color)

       n      Edit note for current slide

       f      Freeze the current presentation display (the presenter display is still
              fully active)

       o      Toggle the overlay flag for one particular slide (see Overlays below)

       p      Pause timer

       r      Reset presentation (reset timer and go back to first slide)

       e      Define end slide


FEATURES
   Caching / Prerendering
       To allow fast changes between the different slides of the presentation the pdf
       pages  are  prerendered to memory.  The progress bar on the bottom of the pre‐
       senter screen indicates how many percent of the slides have been  pre-rendered
       already.   During  the  initial  rendering  phase  this  will  slow-down slide
       changes, as most cpu power is used for the  rendering  process  in  the  back‐
       ground.  After the cache is fully primed however the changing of slides should
       be much faster, as with normal pdf viewers.

       As the prerendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using the  --dis‐
       able-cache switch at the cost of speed.

   Timer
       If a duration is given (-d option), the timer will show a countdown  with  the
       given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a value of 0 is given to
       the -d option), the timer will show how much time has been spent.   The  dura‐
       tion  is stored automatically, so you do not need to repeat it for every invo‐
       cation.

       The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first  page  for  the
       first  time.   This  feature  is  quite  useful  as  you  may want to show the
       titlepage of your presentation while people are still entering  the  room  and
       the  presentation  hasn't really begun yet.  If you want to start over you can
       use the r key which will make the presenter reset the timer.

       If a duration is given, at the moment the timer reaches the defined  last-min‐
       utes  value it will change color to indicate your talk is nearing its end.  As
       soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00) it will turn red and  count
       further  down showing a negative time, to provide information on how many min‐
       utes you are overtime.


   Notes
       Textual notes can be displayed for each slide.   While  in  the  presentation,
       pressing  n will allow you to take notes for the screen.  To go out of editing
       mode, press the Escape key.  Note that while editing a  note  the  keybindings
       stop working, i.e.  you are not able to change slides.

       The  notes  are  stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy to edit
       also from outside the program.  See the section about the pdfpc format below.


   Overview mode
       Pressing tab you can enter the overview mode, where miniatures for the  slides
       are  shown.   You  can  select one slide to jump to with the mouse or with the
       arrow keys.  You can also define overlays and the end  slide  (see  next  sec‐
       tions) in this mode.


   Overlays
       Many  slide  preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e.  sets of slides that
       are logically grouped together as a single, changing slide.  Examples  include
       enumerations  where  the single items are displayed one after another or rough
       "animations", where parts of a picture change from slide to slide.   Pdf  Pre‐
       senter Console includes facilities for dealing with such overlays.

       In  this  description,  we will differentiation between slides (i.e.  pages in
       the pdf document) and "user slides", that are the logical slides.   The  stan‐
       dard forward movement command (page down, enter, etc.) moves through one slide
       at a time, as expected.  That means that every step in  the  overlay  is  tra‐
       versed.  The backward movement command works differently depending if the cur‐
       rent and previous slides are part of an overlay:

       the state of the current slide.

       When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated in the
       presenter view, just below the main view, showing the next  and  the  previous
       slide in an overlay.

       Pdf  Presenter  Console  tries to find these overlays automatically by looking
       into the page labels in the pdf file.  For LaTeX this works correctly at least
       with  the beamer class and also modifying the page numbers manually (compiling
       with pdflatex).  If your preferred slide-producing method does not  work  cor‐
       rectly  with  this  detection, you can supply this information using the o key
       for each slide that is part of an overlay (except the first one!).   The  page
       numbering is also adapted.  This information is automatically stored.


   End slide
       Some  people  like to have some additional, backup slides after the last slide
       in the actual presentation.  Things like bibliographic  references  or  slides
       referring  to  specialized questions are typical examples.  Pdf Presenter Con‐
       sole lets you define which is the last slide in the  actual  presentation  vie
       the  'e' key.  This just changes the progress display in the presenter screen,
       as to have a better overview of how many slides are left.

   pdfpc Files
       The notes and other additional information are  stored  in  a  file  with  the
       extension "pdfpc".  When invoking Pdf Presenter Console with a non pdfpc file,
       it automatically checks if there exists such a file and in this case loads the
       additional information.  This means that you normally do not have to deal with
       this kind of files explicitly.

       There are however cases where you may want to edit the  files  manually.   The
       most  typical  case  is if you add or remove some slides after you have edited
       notes or defined overlays.  It may be quicker to edit the pdfpc file  than  to
       re-enter  the  whole  information.  Future versions may include external tools
       for dealing with this case automatically.

       The files are plain-text files that should be fairly self-explanatory.  A cou‐
       ple  of things to note - The slide numbers of the notes refer to user slides -
       The [notes] sections must be the last one in the file -  For  the  programmers
       out there: slide indexes start at 1


BUGS
       There  may  be a small memory leak in the program. I am trying to solve it. It
       should not be too important for up to some hundreds of slides.
