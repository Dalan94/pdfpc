<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>pdfpc</B> [options] PDF-file



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote
       like multi-monitor output to provide meta information  to  the  speaker
       during the presentation.  It is able to show a normal presentation win‚Äê
       dow on one screen, while showing a more sophisticated overview  on  the
       other  one  providing  information like a picture of the next slide, as
       well as the left over time till the end of the presentation.  The input
       files  processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be created using
       nearly any of today's presentation software.

       To run pdfppc, simply type

              pdfpc file.pdf

       By default the presenter view appears in the primary  monitor  and  the
       presentation  view  in  the second monitor (provided you have two moni‚Äê
       tors).  If you want to swith displays, start with the  -s  option  (see
       below).

              If not given or if a value of 0 is  specified,  the  clock  just
              measures the time in the presentation.

       <B>-e,</B> <B>--end-time</B><I>=T</I>
              End time of the presentation. (Format: HH:MM (24h))

       <B>-t,</B> <B>--start-time</B><I>=T</I>
              Start  time of the presentation to be used as a countdown. (For‚Äê
              mat: HH:MM (24h))

       <B>-l,</B> <B>--last-minutes</B><I>=N</I>
              Time in minutes, from which on  the  timer  changes  its  color.
              (Default 5 minutes)

       <B>-u,</B> <B>--current-size</B><I>=N</I>
              Percentage  of  the  presenter screen to be used for the current

              Minimum width for the overview miniatures, in  pixels.  (Default
              150)

       <B>-s,</B> <B>--switch-screens</B>
              Force to use only one screen

       <B>-h,</B> <B>--help</B>
              Shows the help

<H2>KEYBINDINGS</H2><PRE>
       During the presentation following key strokes and mouse clicks are sup‚Äê
       ported:

       <B>Right</B> <B>cursor</B> <B>key</B> <B>/</B> <B>Page</B> <B>down</B> <B>/</B> <B>Return</B> <B>/</B> <B>Space</B> <B>/</B> <B>Left</B> <B>mouse</B> <B>button</B>
              Go forward one slide

       <B>Shift</B> <B>+</B> <B>Right</B> <B>cursor</B> <B>key</B> <B>/</B> <B>Page</B> <B>down</B> <B>/</B> <B>Return</B> <B>/</B> <B>Space</B> <B>/</B> <B>Left</B> <B>mouse</B> <B>but</B>‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê
       <B>ton</B> <B>/</B> <B>Mouse</B> <B>wheel</B> <B>down</B> <B>or</B> <B>right</B>
              Go forward 10 slides

       <B>Down</B> <B>cursor</B> <B>key</B>
              Go forward one user slide (see section about overlays below)

       <B>Left</B> <B>cursor</B> <B>key</B> <B>/</B> <B>Page</B> <B>up</B> <B>/</B> <B>Right</B> <B>mouse</B> <B>button</B> <B>/</B> <B>Mouse</B> <B>wheel</B> <B>up</B> <B>or</B> <B>left</B>
              Go back one slide

       <B>Shift</B> <B>+</B> <B>Left</B> <B>cursor</B> <B>key</B> <B>/</B> <B>Page</B> <B>up</B> <B>/</B> <B>Right</B> <B>mouse</B> <B>button</B>
              Go back 10 slides

       <B>Up</B> <B>cursor</B> <B>key</B>
              Go back one "user slide" (see section about overlays below)

       <B>Home</B>   Go to the first slide

       <B>End</B>    Go to the last slide

       <B>Backspace</B>
              Go  back in history. Note that history is defined by "jump" com‚Äê
              mands, not by normal slide movement.

       <B>Tab</B>    Toggle overview mode

       <B>g</B>      Input a slide number to jump to

       <B>Escape</B> <B>/</B> <B>q</B>
              Exit pdfpc

       <B>b</B>      Turn off the presentation view  (i.e.   fill  it  with  a  black
              color)

       <B>n</B>      Edit note for current slide

       <B>f</B>      Freeze  the  current presentation display (the presenter display
              is still fully active)

       tom  of  the  presenter screen indicates how many percent of the slides
       have been pre-rendered already.  During  the  initial  rendering  phase
       this  will  slow-down  slide changes, as most cpu power is used for the
       rendering process in the background.  After the cache is  fully  primed
       however  the  changing  of slides should be much faster, as with normal
       pdf viewers.

       As the prerendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using  the
       --disable-cache switch at the cost of speed.

   <B>Cache</B> <B>compression</B>
       The  prerendered  and cached slides can be compressed in memory to save
       up some memory.  Without compression a set of about 100 pdf  pages  can
       easily  grow  up to about 1.5gb size.  Netbooks with only 1gb of memory
       would swap themselves to death if prerendering is  enabled  in  such  a
       situation.   The  compression is enabled by default as it does not harm
       rendering speed in a noticeable way on most systems.  It  does  however
       slows down prerendering by about a factor of 2.  If you have got enough
       memory and want to ensure the fastest  possible  prerendering  you  can
       disable  slide  compression by using the -z switch. But be warned using
       the uncompressed prerendering storage will use about 30 times the  mem‚Äê
       ory  the  new  compressed  storage utilizes (aka the 1.5gb become about
       50mb)



   <B>Timer</B>
       If a duration is given (-d option), the timer  will  show  a  countdown
       with  the given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a value
       of 0 is given to the -d option), the timer will show how much time  has
       been  spent.   The duration is stored automatically, so you do not need
       to repeat it for every invocation.

       The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for
       the  first  time.  This feature is quite useful as you may want to show
       the titlepage of your presentation while people are still entering  the
       room  and  the  presentation  hasn't  really begun yet.  If you want to
       start over you can use the r key which will make  the  presenter  reset
       the timer.

       If  a  duration  is  given, at the moment the timer reaches the defined
       last-minutes value it will change color to indicate your talk is  near‚Äê
       ing  its end.  As soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00) it
       will turn red and count further down showing a negative time,  to  pro‚Äê
       vide information on how many minutes you are overtime.


   <B>Notes</B>
       Textual  notes can be displayed for each slide.  While in the presenta‚Äê
       tion, pressing n will allow you to take notes for the  screen.   To  go
       out  of  editing mode, press the Escape key.  Note that while editing a
       note the keybindings stop working, i.e.  you are  not  able  to  change

   <B>Overlays</B>
       Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e.  sets of slides
       that are logically grouped together as a single, changing slide.  Exam‚Äê
       ples include enumerations where the  single  items  are  displayed  one
       after  another  or  rough "animations", where parts of a picture change
       from slide to slide.  Pdf Presenter  Console  includes  facilities  for
       dealing with such overlays.

       In  this  description,  we  will  differentiation  between slides (i.e.
       pages in the pdf document) and "user  slides",  that  are  the  logical
       slides.  The standard forward movement command (page down, enter, etc.)
       moves through one slide at a time, as expected.  That means that  every
       step  in the overlay is traversed.  The backward movement command works
       differently depending if the current and previous slides are part of an
       overlay:


       ¬∑ If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previ‚Äê
         ous slide.  That means that we are in the middle of an overlay we can
         jump forward and backward through the single steps of it

       ¬∑ If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first
         one), but the previous slides are,  we  jump  to  the  previous  user
         slide.   This  means  that when going back in the presentation you do
         not have to go through every step of the overlay, Pdf Presenter  Con‚Äê
         sole just shows the first slide of the each overlay.  As you normally
         only go back in a presentation when looking  for  a  concrete  slide,
         this is more convenient.

       The  up  and  down cursor keys work on a user slide basis.  You can use
       them to skip the rest of an overlay or to jump  to  the  previous  user
       slide, ignoring the state of the current slide.

       When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated
       in the presenter view, just below the main view, showing the  next  and
       the previous slide in an overlay.

       Pdf  Presenter  Console  tries  to find these overlays automatically by
       looking into the page labels in the pdf file.   For  LaTeX  this  works
       correctly  at  least  with the beamer class and also modifying the page
       numbers manually (compiling with pdflatex).  If your  preferred  slide-
       producing  method  does not work correctly with this detection, you can
       supply this information using the o key for each slide that is part  of
       an  overlay  (except  the  first  one!).   The  page  numbering is also
       adapted.  This information is automatically stored.


   <B>End</B> <B>slide</B>
       Some people like to have some additional, backup slides after the  last
       slide in the actual presentation.  Things like bibliographic references
       or slides referring to specialized questions are typical examples.  Pdf
       Presenter Console lets you define which is the last slide in the actual
       pdfpc file than to re-enter the whole information.  Future versions may
       include external tools for dealing with this case automatically.

       The files are plain-text files that should be fairly  self-explanatory.
       A  couple  of  things to note - The slide numbers of the notes refer to
       user slides - The [notes] sections must be the last one in the  file  -
       For the programmers out there: slide indexes start at 1

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       There  may  be a small memory leak in the program. I am trying to solve
       it. It should not be too important for up to some hundreds of slides.

       Other bugs can be reported at <I>https://github.com/davvil/pdfpc/issues</I>
