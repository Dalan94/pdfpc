<h1>About</h1>

<p>pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote like
multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the speaker during the
presentation. It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen,
while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other one providing
information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the left over time
till the end of the presentation. The input files processed by pdfpc are PDF
documents, which can be created using nearly any of today's presentation
software.</p>

To get a better feeling of pdfpc, install it, download the <a
    href=demo/pdfpc-demo.pdf>demo presentation</a> and start it with
<pre><code>pdfpc pdfpc-demo.pdf</code></pre>

<h1>Download</h1>

Currently pdfpc is only available through <a
    href="https://github.com/davvil/pdfpc">github</a>. Head over there and
follow the compilation instructions.

If you use <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, you can
download the <a
    href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=58957">AUR</a> package.

<!--
</ul><h1>Compile and install</h1>

<p>After retrieving the archive unpack it using the following command::</p>

<pre><code>tar xvzf pdf_presenter_console-VERSION.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Switch to the unpacked source directory and create some sort of build
directory. This may be done as follows::</p>

<pre><code>cd pdf_presenter_console-VERSION
mkdir build
cd build
</code></pre>

<p>After you are inside the build directory create the needed Makefiles using
CMake::</p>

<pre><code>cmake ../
</code></pre>

<p>If you have put your build directory elsewhere on your system adapt the path
above accordingly. You need to provide CMake with the pdf_presenter_console
directory which you just decompressed.</p>

<p>You may alter the final installation prefix at this time. By default the
pdf_presenter_console executable will be installed under <em>/usr/local/bin</em>. If
you want to change that, for example to be <em>/usr/bin</em> you may specify another
installation prefix as follows::</p>

<pre><code>cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" ../
</code></pre>

<p>If all requirements are met CMake will tell you that it created all the
necessary build files for you. If any of the requirements were not met you
will be informed of it to provide the necessary files or install the
appropriate packages.</p>

<p>The next step is to compile the source using GNU Make or any other make
derivative you may have installed. Simply issue the following command to start
building the application::</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>After the build completes successfully the <em>pdf_presenter_console</em> executable
can be found inside the <em>src</em> directory of you build path. If you want to
install it automatically to the <em>bin</em> directory below the before provided
prefix do as follows::</p>

<pre><code>make install
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to prefix this command with a <em>sudo</em> or obtain super-user rights
in any other way applicable to your situation.</p>

<p>Congratulations you just installed Pdf Presenter Console on your system.</p>

<h2>Retrieving the current trunk from the softwares git repository</h2>

<p>If you want to use the bleeding edge version of this software, you may always
retrieve the current development branch from its git repository. Do this on
your own risk. It may not compile, make your socks disappear or even eat your
cat ;).</p>

<p>The repository is hosted at github__. If the git executable is available on
your system it can be retrieved using the following command::</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/jakobwesthoff/Pdf-Presenter-Console.git
</code></pre>

<p>After it has been transfered you need to switch to the
<code>Pdf-Presenter-Console</code> directory, which has just been created. From inside
this directory use these commands to retrieve all needed submodules::</p>

<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

<p>You are now set to compile and install the presenter as described in the
section above. However as mentioned above the code might not compile at all.</p>
